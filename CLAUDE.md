## Project Context
Take-home project for Greptile (Series A startup, <20 employees). They value speed, product intuition, and attention to detail.

**Deadline:** January 3rd, 2025

## Documentation Rule
**Every technical and product decision must be documented in README.md with reasoning.**

When a decision is made during development, immediately add it to the README under a "Decisions" section. Include:
- What was decided
- Why (trade-offs considered)
- Alternatives rejected

This is a Greptile evaluation criterion: "feel free to share why you made the technical and product decisions that you made."

## Evaluation Criteria (from Greptile)
- Does it work?
- Does the backend logic make sense?
- Is there evidence of user-centered product design choices?
- Is it pretty (simple and minimal can be beautiful)?
- How is the UX from the developer's perspective?
